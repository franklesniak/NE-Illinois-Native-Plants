# Northeastern Illinois (Chicagoland Area) Native Plants

 A native plants database focused on northeastern Illinois, including Chicago and portions of Wisconsin and Indiana

## How to Use

In GitHub, click the file `NE-IL-Natives.xlsx`, then click `Download` (note: if you don't see the file `NE-IL-Natives.xlsx`, you may need to click `View code` first).

After you click `Download`, the Excel file will download.
The file will be present in your `Downloads` folder.
Navigate to the folder, then open the downloaded file with Excel.

Alternatively, if you do not have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer, you may also [view the file on the web](https://frenchcries-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/flesniak/EuiTSo5Ik3tJhH-XaCyP7y0BZehzVZZ1ZzRQbVr8Ug__ZA?e=wf8Vbn).

Once you have the file open, we recommend filtering down to just those plants native to the county where you are designing/planting.
To do so, click the dropdown corresponding to the county, and uncheck the checkbox for `(blanks)`.

Next, scroll to the right and use the various column dropdowns to filter the plant listing based on your site or desired plant criteria.

For example:

- If you want plants that are approximately 2 feet tall, click the dropdown for `2 ft` plant height and uncheck the checkbox for `(blanks)`.
- If you want only purple flowers, click the dropdown for `Purple`, then uncheck the checkbox for `(blanks)`.
- If you know your site has a prominent amount of clay in the soil, click the dropdown for `Clay` soil and uncheck the checkbox for `(blanks)`.
- If you are working in a shaded planting location, click the dropdown for `Shade` (Sun), and uncheck the checkbox for `(blanks)`.

Once you have applied filters that match your site conditions and preferences, you should have a concise list of plants!
